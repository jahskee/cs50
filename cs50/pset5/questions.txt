0. A lung disease, characterized by inflammation of lungs caused by inhalation of silica dust.

1. A program that measures the usage of Memory and CPU time by a process or processes.

2. 16 members in structure.

3. Passing by reference saves memory resource and time when data is large, 
   than passing by value which creates a copy of the data object to pass.

4. After opening the dictionary text file, it will do for loop to check content of each file
   delimited by a new line character. It will continue to read the file line by line
   until it encounters the EOF and stops.

5. Using fgetc is better approach because it does not have to allocate memory ahead, 
   before reading from file. It does not impose limit on the length of the word of the textfile.
   It also allows the program to inspect the character while reading from file. fscanf reads
   the entire line of words and requires dynamic allocation of read buffer and cannot inspect
   each character being read, but requires a separate code to accomplish that. fgetc is more
   flexible approach in most situations

6. The constant parameters are not intended to be updated in the function,
   this adds extra protection that a parameter cannot be updated.

7.  Used Hash table with linked list, its size is 1024 and each node in linked list has a maximum size of 46.
    The linked list ends when pointer node is set to null.

8   Looks fast, I estimate rarely hits upperbound bigOh(n), as the nature of the hash table it is near the lower bound omega(1) most of the time.

9.  I am optimizing each time I write the code, but nothing very specific.

10. So far i see the statistics time in total is getting better that is close to the CS staff 50 solution.
    Possible improvement find better hash function for good distribution.
